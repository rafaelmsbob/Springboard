# FILES DESCRIPTION
## FinalReport.pdf
<b>Most important file!</b>. Contains detailed explanation of all the steps taken thoughout the project: Data Preparation, Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models application.
It contains screenshots from the two notebook files ("Data Preparation" and "ML Algorithms"), making the explanations easy to follow.

## Data Preparation.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook where the raw dataset is loaded. You will find some data wrangling techniques, Exploratory Data Analysis and some specific actions to prepare the dataset to
the next part of the project: Machine Learning Classification models exploration, which is produced on the next Jupyter Notebook file.

## ML Algorithms.ipynb
Dataset from previous Notebook is loaded and several Machine Learning Classification models are tested. You will also find how I am defining both the accuracy and the benchmark.
<b>Plot twist</b>: Sklearn's Dummy Model wasn't challenging enough for me, so I defined a benchmark of my own.

## Final Presentation.pptx
Powerpoint slides with the highlights of the project.

## fromRawToPrediction.py
Python file that goes all the way from loading the raw dataset to the application of the best model. Needs the file below to run.

## FRTPfunctions.py
Python module from where all the functions used on the previous file are imported.

# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
## Project Name: 
Vehicle Loan Default Prediction

## Summary: 
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Classification Algorithms on a Vehicle Loan Dataset to try to increase loan default prediction accuracy.

## Proposal: 
Increase the predictability of a vehicle loan default, based on borrower data, loan data and Bureau data. The goal is to define a predicting model better than what is
currently in place.

## Final deliverable of this project: 
A Machine Learning model capable of providing good loan default predictions, along with jupyter notebooks and a report to walk the reader though the process.


<i>This project is part of Springboard's Data Science career track curriculum. It is a great opportunity to apply all the theory we learned throughout the course. All the ideas and execution are mine, with guidance from an Industry expert, my mentor Kenneth Gil Pasquel.</i>
