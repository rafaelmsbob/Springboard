# Overview
## Project Name: 
Vehicle Loan Default Prediction

## Summary: 
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Classification Algorithms on a Vehicle Loan Dataset to try to increase loan default prediction accuracy.

## Proposal: 
Increase the predictability of a vehicle loan default, based on borrower data, loan data and Bureau data.

## Final deliverable of this project: 
A Machine Learning model capable of providing good loan default predictions.


<i>This project is part of Springboard's Data Science career track curriculum. It is a great opportunity to apply all the theory we learned throughout the course. All the ideas and execution are mine, with guidance from an Industry expert, my mentor Kenneth.</i>
