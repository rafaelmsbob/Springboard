# Overview
<p><b>Project Name: </b>Making Houses More Appealing to Buyers</p>
<p><b>Summary: </b>Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms on a Housing Dataset to support which
home improvement may positively affect the Selling Price</p>
<p><b>Proposal: </b>This study is the first two parts of a more ambitious study that would recommend homeowners and home brokers 
which home improvements would greatly impact the selling price. The outcome of the complete version of the study would be a “portfolio”
of possible home upgrades, alongside with the cost and duration of the project, and the estimated increase in the selling price. 
This would be presented to homeowners and home brokers, allowing them to either sell a “harder-to-sell” house faster or
to maximize their profits.</p>
<p><b>Final deliverable of this project: </b> A Machine Learning model capable of providing good predictions for a random house. This way, we could apply
the model to a specific house and provide a list of “actionable variables” that have the most positive impact on the selling price.</p>

<i>This project is part of Springboard's Data Science career track curriculum. It is a great opportunity to apply all the
theory we learned throughout the course. All the ideas and execution are mine, with little guidance from an Industry expert, my
mentor Kenneth.</i>
